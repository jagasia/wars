	so far, we created Servlet programs	

		java class that can contain html code

	PrintWriter out=response.getWriter();
	out.print("Click <a href=\"login.html\"> here </a>to go to home page");

sometimes, this <a> is printed in the browser rather than making it a hyper link.

	response.setContentType("text/html");



looking at the above code, we find a java program containing html code inside



jsp
	Java Server Pages



	we write HTML code, inside which we embed Java code

<%@ page language="java" contentType="text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1"
    pageEncoding="ISO-8859-1"%>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="ISO-8859-1">
<title>Insert title here</title>
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>



<%@ page language="java" contentType="text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1"
    pageEncoding="ISO-8859-1"%>


this above line differentiates a JSP file from a HTML file

what is this line?
	this is called as "directive"
	
	Page directive informs the runtime that this page is coded in java and content type is text/html character set is ISO/ ascii or utf-8



<%	%>
	this is called as scriplet		inside this scriplet tag, we can write java code


in JSP,
	we do not need to declare the below code:
		PrintWriter out=response.getWriter();

	it is automatically done by container 

	not only "out" variable,

	lot of variables are already present. we do not need to declare

they are called as implicit objects

	request
	response
	application
	session
	out
	

these are implicit objects


JSP building blocks:

	scriplet			<%	%>
	declaration			<%!	%>
	comment				<%!-	--%>
	expression			<%=	%>
	directive			<%@	%>


Expression:

	<%=20 %>		this will be equal to 				out.print(20);
	
Directive:

	<%@page
	<%@include
	<%@taglib

	only 3 directives present in  a jsp file



how we can display dynamic content in html input controls?
	
	response.sendRedirect()		method is used to redirect to other pages using java servlet code



Branch ID: <input type=text name=bid class="form-control" value="<%=bid %>" /> Branch


if bid variable is not initialized then we have problem

jsp provides EL		(Expression language) to shorten thse codes

${}			this is EL


in expression language	
	request.getParameter("bid")		is 		${param.bid}




JSTL
